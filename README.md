# Welcome to Xray api (In development process) ðŸ‘‹
**We currently support `Python`, `C++` and `Ruby`**

To use, first download this repository and enter the `dist` folder and select the programming language you want and then copy the folder and use it.

In the future, we will convert the project into a downloadable library of package managers for different languages
